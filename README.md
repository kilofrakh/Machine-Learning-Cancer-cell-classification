# Machine Learning Cancer Cell Classification

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify cancer cells as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features. The model is trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

## Features
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Implements various classification models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing includes normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Features extracted from cell nuclei images
- Labels indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kilofrakh/Machine-Learning-Cancer-cell-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Cancer-cell-classification
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.

## Model Performance
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**
- **Classification Report**

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning models for improved accuracy
- Deploying the model as a web application
